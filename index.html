    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I am a husband, a father, and an IT worker. I developed a love of
      computers when my family got our first Windows 95 machine. Now I am an
      avid Linux user and open source advocate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am CompTIA A+ and Network+ certified. Next year I will be taking
      Security+ as well. I have a passion for IT security and would love to work
      in pentesting one day.
