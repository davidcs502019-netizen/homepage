    <h1>Video Projects</h1>
    <p>
      While studying HTML through MDN, I was encouraged to work on audio and
      video projects as well. This will mostly be short clips, fragments of
      ideas, and works in progress, but I wanted a place to collect them and
      share them.

            Your browser doesn't support this video. Here is a

          This is an example of the htop command in action. Most Linux
          distributions have this package available in their repositories. To
          install in Ubuntu or other Debian based systems run
          <code>sudo apt install htop</code>. Then to run the command, simply
          type <code>htop</code>. This will show CPU usage, RAM and Swap usage,
          system uptime, and individual processes and their information.
