    <h1>Audio Projects</h1>
    <p>
      While studying HTML through MDN, I was encouraged to work on audio and
      video projects as well. This will mostly be snippets, fragments of ideas,
      and works in progress, but I wanted a place to collect them and share
      them.

          This was my first music project that I made after starting web
          development. I learned how to generate square-wave tones in Audacity,
          and created a simple melody with a slightly erratic feeling. I layered
          bass tones underneath to give chord structure, with a slight gap in
          every other bass note to give just a slight bounce to it.
